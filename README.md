Portfolio Project – Personal Website

This project is a personal portfolio website designed and developed to reflect both my technical skill set and my design thinking process. The goal was to create a clean, structured interface that feels intentional, human, and easy to navigate, while maintaining scalable and maintainable code.

From a technical perspective, the site is built using React with a component-driven architecture. Each section—such as the passion cards, overview cards, and contact section, is implemented as a reusable component to keep the codebase modular and easy to extend. Styling is handled with plain CSS, allowing precise control over layout, spacing, and typography without relying on utility frameworks. This approach helped me focus on clarity, hierarchy, and long-term maintainability.

I paid close attention to responsive layout behavior, alignment consistency, and visual balance, ensuring that elements scale naturally rather than relying on fixed dimensions wherever possible. Pseudo-elements and modern CSS techniques are used for decorative elements (such as card accents) to keep the markup clean and semantic.

Beyond the technical execution, this project reflects how I approach design: with empathy, structure, and intention. My interests outside of the screen—observation, creativity, and attention to detail—directly inform how I think about user experience and interface clarity. This portfolio is not just a showcase of work, but a representation of how I think, build, and refine digital experiences.
